# glacier
Yet another tool for manipulating with AWS Glacier.

It is a bash-script and it uses SQLite for mantaining the local DB for keeping track of the archives 
uploaded to the Glacier.

Probably it is somewhat and somehow better then other four hundreed same-purpose tools living on the GitHub.
I even hope this is true, but I am not sure. Everyone can try (this one and other 400) and decide.
